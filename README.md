# Automated-Firefighting-Rover
A fully automated Rover that detects fire using Digital Image Processing. Goes near it stops at a safe distance and extinguishes the fire.
This contains two .py files. One is to manually control the Rover while other is to function the rover automatically.

Initially, the rover rotates to find fire. It detects fire using DIP methods. Using the motors it rotates the wheels to centralize the position of the fire and moves forward near it. An IR sensor with only a receiver is used to detect the presence of fire. When it is enough close IR detects fire and the rover stops. It then takes steps to extinguish the fire. It also contains Object Avoidance to avoid obstacles or objects hat occur during its way.
